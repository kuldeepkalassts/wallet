## Wallet Application: 
### Project Description

This application allows users to create wallets, manage funds, and perform transactions. It also features the creation and management of virtual currencies, enabling users to have a flexible and customizable financial experience.

### Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (or similar relational database)
* **Cloud Platform:** AWS, Azure, or GCP (your choice)
* **Additional Considerations:**
    * Security: Implement security measures like authentication and authorization.
    * Scalability: Design the application to handle a large number of users and transactions.
    * Testing: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.
    * Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation for developers and users.

### Microservice Architecture

The application will be broken down into independent microservices for better maintainability and scalability. Here are some potential microservices:

* **User Service:** Handles user registration, authentication, and authorization.
* **Wallet Service:** Manages wallet creation, configuration, and balance updates.
* **Transaction Service:** Processes transactions between wallets and handles currency conversion.
* **Virtual Currency Service:** Enables users to create and manage virtual currencies.

### User Flows

The following user flows illustrate typical interactions within the application:

**1. User Registration and Wallet Creation**

* User registers for an account.
* User creates their first wallet.

**2. Add Funds to Wallet**

* User selects their wallet.
* User enters the amount to add.
* User confirms the transaction.
* Wallet balance is updated with the added funds.

**3. Withdraw Funds from Wallet**

* User selects their wallet.
* User enters the withdrawal amount.
* User confirms the transaction.
* Wallet balance is updated with the withdrawn funds.

**4. Transfer Funds Between Wallets**

* User selects the sending wallet.
* User selects the receiving wallet.
* User enters the transfer amount.
* User confirms the transaction.
* Sending wallet balance decreases.
* Receiving wallet balance increases.

**5. Create Virtual Currency**

* User selects their wallet.
* User enters the virtual currency details (name, symbol).
* User confirms creation.
* New virtual currency is associated with the user's wallet.

**6. Configure Wallet Currency**

* User selects their wallet.
* User chooses the currency type (virtual or real-world).
* User selects the specific virtual currency (if applicable).
* User confirms the configuration.
* Wallet configuration is updated with the chosen currency.

**7. Convert Between Currencies**

* User selects their wallet.
* User chooses the source currency (virtual or real-world).
* User chooses the target currency (virtual or real-world).
* User enters the amount to convert.
* User confirms the conversion.
* Wallet balance is updated with the converted funds.

**8. View Transaction History**

* User selects their wallet.
* Transaction history for the wallet is displayed.

**9. View Wallet Balance**

* User selects their wallet.
* Current balance of the wallet is displayed.

### Next Steps

This README provides a high-level overview of the project. Future steps include:

* Detailed API design for each microservice.
* Database schema design.
* Implementation of backend functionalities.
* Design and development of the frontend application (optional).

By following this approach, we can build a robust and scalable wallet application that meets the needs of our users.
